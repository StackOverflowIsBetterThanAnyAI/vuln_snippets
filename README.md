# vuln_snippets
 This is a test repository that contains vulnerable code snippets in various programming languages. The scope of this repository is to help me test my automated security assistant (which is my CS Degree thesis project).
 The code snippets will be passed one by one to an LLM, and it will conduct a security analysis on the code.

 **Note**: These code snippets are generated by ChatGPT 3.5 and are vulnerable by design
